### *just-add-water*&nbsp;CSS animations (animate.css)

animate.css is a bunch of cool, fun, and cross-browser animations for you to use in your projects. Great for emphasis, home pages, sliders, and general just-add-water-awesomeness. 

To use animate.css in your website, simply drop the stylesheet into your document's <head>, and add the class animated to an element, along with any of the animation names. That's it! You've got a CSS animated element. Super!

Add to the `<head>` saciton:


`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animate.css/3.7.2/animate.min.css">`

.center[
<video loop autoplay width="200" height="320" muted>
    <source src="../../../img/animate.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
]

---

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animate.css/3.7.2/animate.min.css">

To animate an element, add the class `animated` to an element. You can include the class `infinite` for an infinite loop. 

Finally you would add a class that specify what kind of animation you want the element to have. 

Some examples are `bounce`, `pulse`, `zoomInRight`, `slideOutDown` and many more. 

Find the full list of available classes here: https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/

The example:

```css
<h1 class="animated infinite bounceIn delay-2s">
  I'm a full animated heading
</h1>
```

.center.animated.infinite.bounceIn.delay-2s[
<h1>I'm a full animated heading</h1>
]

### CSS Transitions

Transitions are the grease in the wheel of CSS transforms. Without a transition, an element being transformed would change abruptly from one state to another. By applying a transition you can control the change, making it smooth and gradual.

No transition:
<div class="no-transition-box"></div>

With transition:
<div class="transition-box"></div>

There are two properties that are required in order for the transition to take effect:

`transition-property`

`transition-duration`

```css
  transition-property: width;
  transition-duration: 0.5s;
```

---

##`transition-timing`

The transition-timing-function property allows you to define the speed of the transition over the duration. 

The default timing is `ease`, which starts out slow, quickly speeds up, and then slows down at the end. The other timing options are: `linear`, `ease`, `ease-in`, `ease-out`, and `ease-in-out`.

```css
transition-timing-function: ease-in;
```


<video loop autoplay width="500" height="400" muted>
    <source src="../../../img/transition-timing.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>

---

### CSS transforms

transforms - how to make an element change from one state to another. With the CSS transform property you can `rotate`, `move`, `skew`, and `scale` elements.

.side-by-side[

.no-scroll[
```css
.droplet {
  background: mediumaquamarine;
  border-radius: 2% 50%;
  height: 100px;
  margin: 100px;
  transition: transform 3s;
  transition-timing: ease-in-out;
  width: 100px;

  &:hover {
    transform: rotate(1080deg);
  }
}
```
]

<div class="droplet"></div>

]

---

### CSS Animations

The `animation` property in CSS can be used to animate many other CSS properties such as `color`, `background-color`, `height`, or `width`. Each animation needs to be defined with the @keyframes at-rule which is then called with the animation property, like so:

.side-by-side[

```css
.element {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  animation: itrotates 5s infinite;
  background: #7C0C84;
}

@keyframes itrotates {
  0% {
    transform: rotate(0deg);
    border-radius: 0;
  }
  100% {
    transform: rotate(90deg);
    border-radius: 50%;
  }
}```

<div class="element"></div>
