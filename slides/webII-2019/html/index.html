```html
<header></header>```

.footnote[
https://html.com/tags/header/
]

The `<header>` element is used to identify content that precedes the primary content of the web page and often contains website branding, navigation elements, search forms, and similar content that is duplicated across all or most pages of a website.
#### As a page header
Typically, when the `<header>` element is used as a page header, it contains the site's title or logo (or both) and the main site navigation.
    
```html
<body>
  <header>
  <a src="/" id="logo">Site Title</a>
  <nav>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
    <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav> 
  </header>
<main>...</main>
<footer>...</footer>
</body>```

---

.mt-1[
```html
<nav></nav>```
]

.footnote[
https://html.com/tags/nav/
]

The `<nav>` element identifies a group of navigation links. Links in a `<nav>` element may point to other webpages or to different sections of the same webpage.

Code Example:

```html
<nav>
  <a href="/flamingo-facts/">Flamingo Facts</a> | 
  <a href="/flamingo-food/">Flamingo Food</a> | 
  <a href="/flamingo-species/">Flamingo Species</a> | 
  <a href="/flamingo-habitat/">Flamingo Habitat</a> | 
  <a href="/flamingo-mail/">Contact Us</a> 
</nav>```

---

```html
<aside></aside>```

.footnote[
https://html.com/tags/aside/
]

The `<aside>` element is used to identify content that is related to the primary content of the webpage, but does not constitute the primary content of the page. Author information, related links, related content, and advertisements are exampes of content that may be found in an aside element.

Any of the following may be valid uses of the `<aside>` element:

* bibliography or endnotes
* comments
* pull quotes
* editorial sidebars
* additional information
* wbebsite sidebars unrelated to the content

The following are most likely not good uses of the <aside> element:
* article 
* post 
* data (byline, publication date, etc.)
* post-specific navigation, such as next and previous or related posts

---

### Code Example
```html
<!-- Several potential placements for <aside> -->

<body>
  <main>
    <article>
      <header>
        <h1>Title of Article</h1>
        <!-- Post Data: Byline, dateline -->
      </header>
      <main>
      <!-- Article Content -->
        <aside><!-- Pull Quote --></aside>
      </main>
      <aside>
        <!-- Comment Section -->
      </aside>
      <footer>
        <!-- Post Date: Tags, Categories, Navigation -->
      </footer>
    </article>
  </main>
  <aside>
    <!-- Website sidebar: Advertising, Post Index, Login Forms -->
  </aside>
</body>```

.mt-1[
```html
<main></main>```
]

.footnote[
https://html.com/tags/main/
]

The `<main>` element is a structural and semantic element that defines the main section of a page where the content appears. Similar elements include `<article>`, which denotes an article within an HTML file, and `<aside>`, which describes a note or comment. The `<main>` section is also useful when non-standard devices, such as screen readers, interpret the content of your page. It allows the screen reading device to detect and find the important content rapidly, while it skips over the code at the top of the file. `<main>` is one of 9 structural tags that were introduced in the HTML 5 specification.

  ### Usage

  The `<main>` element can only be used once in each HTML file. It is followed by a closing tag, `</main>`, which should be placed at the end of the content. Both tags must be used outside other structural elements such as `<head>` and its closing tag, and `<footer>`and its closing tag. They cannot overlap them, or sit within them.

.mt-1[
```html
<footer></footer>```
]

.footnote[
https://html.com/tags/footer/
]

The `<footer>` element is a structural element used to identify the footer of a page, document, article, or section. A `<footer>` typically contains copyright and authorship information or navigational elements pertaining to the contents of the parent element.

### Using `<footer>`

The obvious place for the `<footer>` element is at the bottom of a web page. Most sites have a footer (with copyright, contact, and other info), and now, thanks to HTML5, you can create this with the semantic-meaningful `<footer>` element instead of a meaningless `<div>`.

The important thing to remember is that the `<footer>` is related to its parent element. If it inside an `<article>` element, then it is the footer of that article. If it is the last element inside the `<body>` element, then it is the footer of the page as a whole.

---

One of the most common HTML5 sematic tags:

```html
<article>
<aside>
<details>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<header>
<main>
<mark>
<nav>
<section>
<summary>
<time>
```

### Project stucture

Someone once said that the best system is the one that works better for you. This is only true if you never plan on sharing your work with someone else, or if you do not expect to use other people’s code. Here we will try to follow best practices when it comes to project folder structure and how to group and name files in a logical convenient way.

So this is how we'll organize our project throughout our class:

.medium[![project-structure](https://nvc-nenad.github.io/img/project-structure.png)]

---

### Adding external CSS file

In this class, the expectation is that you are familiar with basics of CSS and how to use it in your HTML pages.
We'll quickly go over what we'll need to start.

* Create a css file inside your css folder of your project. You can name it anything you want. In example here, it is _myStyle.css_

* Create a link element in the HTML page’s head area to define the link between the HTML and CSS pages.

.medium.no-scroll[
```html
<link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "css/myStyle.css" />
```
]

* classes

The _.class_ selector selects elements with a specific class attribute. Example how to select and style all elements with `class="intro"`. The HTML: 
.medium.no-scroll[
```html
<p class="intro">My best friend is Mickey.</p>
```
]
The CSS: 
.medium.no-scroll[
```css
.intro {
  color: red;
}
```
]

---

* ids 

The #id selector styles the element with the specified id.

```html 
<div class="intro">
    <p id="firstname">My name is Donald.</p>
</div>
```

The CSS:
```css
#firstname {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

* Create and name a javascript file inside /js folder. Then, include it as the last tag in your `<body>` tag.

Example: 

```html
<body>
  ... 
  ... 
  ...
  <script src="myScript.js"></script>
</body>
```

If you feel like you need more refreshing on your CSS, please do that for next class since we will be moving along to do advanced css techniques etc.
