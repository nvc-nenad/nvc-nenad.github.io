### CSS Grid Layout (aka "Grid").

.full[![](../../../img/css-grid.png)]

CSS Grid is a powerful tool that allows for two-dimensional layouts to be created on the web. 

CSS Grid Layout excels at dividing a page into major regions or defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layer.

---

### `display`

Grid items are placed in rows by default and span the full width of the grid container.

.no-scroll[
```css 
.container {
  display: grid;
}
/* or */
.container {
  display: inline-grid;
}
```
]
 
---

### Explicit Grid

Explicitly set a grid by creating columns and rows with the grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows properties.

.side-by-side[

.no-scroll[
```css
grid-template-rows: 50px 100px;
```
]

.large[![](../../../img/grid-template-rows.png)]

]

.side-by-side[

.no-scroll[
```css
grid-template-columns: 90px 50px 120px;
```
]

.large[![](../../../img/grid-template-columns.png)]

]

---

### Grid Gaps (Gutters)

The grid-column-gap and grid-row-gap properties create gutters between columns and rows.

Grid gaps are only created in between columns and rows, and not along the edge of the grid container ðŸ™Œ .

.side-by-side[

.no-scroll[
```css
grid-row-gap:    20px;
grid-column-gap: 5rem;
```
]

.large[![](../../../img/gutters.png)]

]

---

### Positioning Items by Grid Line Numbers

Grid lines are essentially lines that represent the start of, the end of, or between column and row tracks.
Each line, starting from the start of the track and in the direction of the grid, is numbered incrementally starting from 1.

.side-by-side[

.no-scroll[
```css
grid-row-start:    2;
grid-row-end:      3;
grid-column-start: 2;
grid-column-end:   3;
```
]

.large[![](../../../img/positioning.png)]

]

---

### Spanning Items Across Rows and Columns

Grid items span only one column and row track by default, but can span multiple row and/or column tracks using the same properties to position them.

.side-by-side[

.no-scroll[
```css
grid-column-start: 1;
grid-column-end:   4;
```
]

.large[![](../../../img/span.png)]

]

---

### Naming and Positioning Items by Grid Areas

Like grid line names, grid areas can also be named with the grid-template-areas property. 
Names can then be referenced to position grid items.

.side-by-side[

.no-scroll[
```css
grid-template-areas:   "header header"
                        "content sidebar"
                        "footer footer";
grid-template-rows:    150px 1fr 100px;
grid-template-columns: 1fr 200px;
```
]
